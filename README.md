# _Linked List_


![N|Solid](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220816144425/LLdrawio.png)

Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. They include a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
## Features
- Dynamic Array.
- Ease of Insertion/Deletion.
- ✨Magic ✨

## Development
Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related variables into one place.

```c++
struct Nodo{T info;
	Nodo<T> *sig;
};
```
A template is a simple yet very powerful tool in C++. The simple idea is to pass data type as a parameter so that we don’t need to write the same code for different data types.
```c++
template <class T>
```
In C++, scope resolution operator is ```::``` it is used for to define a function outside a class.
```c++
bool Lista<T>::insertOnList(T dato, int pos)
```
